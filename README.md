Multi-Domain Data Analysis Portfolio: 5 complete projects across Retail, Real Estate, Education, Weather, and Healthcare/Finance demonstrating Python-based data cleaning, visualization, and business insights.

Multi-Domain Data Analysis Portfolio
Overview

This repository contains a Multi-Domain Data Analysis Portfolio showcasing 5 complete data analysis projects across various domains including Retail, Real Estate, Education, Weather, and Healthcare/Finance. Each project demonstrates the complete workflow of data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and insights generation using Python and its data analysis libraries.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate strong practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and business insight generation, which can be used for professional analytics portfolios, internship submissions, or job interviews.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the full project:

python scripts/run_full_project.py


This will generate all insights, visualizations, Excel reports, and a complete PDF report in the Project_Report/ folder.

Python Dependencies

All required Python packages are included in requirements.txt, including:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
openpyxl
fpdf

Project Workflow

Step 1: Load Data

Read datasets into Pandas DataFrames

Preview the data and check for missing values

Understand dataset structure

Step 2: House Dataset Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the house dataset

Visualizations:

House Price Distribution

Price vs Area by Property Type

Price Distribution by Number of Bedrooms

Price Distribution by Location

Step 3: Supermarket Dataset Analysis

EDA on supermarket sales dataset

Visualizations:

Total Sales Distribution

Total Sales by City

Number of Transactions by Payment Mode

Step 4: Feature Engineering & Insights Extraction

Extracted key metrics such as average prices, total sales, popular products, top-performing locations, etc.

Created DataFrames for insights ready to export

Step 5: Generate Reports

Export insights to Final_Report.xlsx with separate sheets for House and Supermarket datasets

Generate a complete PDF report including:

Insights summary

All visualizations

Reports saved in Project_Report/Complete_Report.pdf

Visualizations

House Dataset:

house_price_distribution.png

price_vs_area_property_type.png

price_by_bedrooms.png

price_by_location.png

Supermarket Dataset:

supermarket_total_sales_distribution.png

total_sales_by_city.png

transactions_by_payment_mode.png

These plots are saved in visualizations/ and included in the PDF report.

Reports

Excel Report: Final_Report.xlsx
Contains summarized insights for House and Supermarket datasets.

PDF Report: Complete_Report.pdf
Contains:

Insights summaries

All visualizations

Easy-to-read presentation of the analysis
